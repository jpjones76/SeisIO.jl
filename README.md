# SeisIO
A minimalist, platform-agnostic package for working with univariate geophysical data.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jpjones76/SeisIO.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jpjones76/SeisIO.jl) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ocilv0u1sy41m934/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jpjones76/seisio-jl/branch/master)

## Documentation
http://seisio.readthedocs.org

## Functionality
Includes web clients, readers for several data formats, and writers for SAC and a native SeisIO format. Utility functions allow time synchronization, data merging, and padding time gaps.

| **Web clients** | **Readable File Formats** |
|:----------------|:--------------------------|
| SeedLink | mini-SEED |
| FDSN (data, event, station)| SAC |
|  IRIS (timeeseries) | SEG Y (rev 0, rev 1, PASSCAL/NMT) |
|| Win_32 |
|| UW |

### Installation
From the command line, press `]` to enter the Package environment, then type (or copy) these commands:

```
add https://github.com/jpjones76/SeisIO.jl; build; precompile; test SeisIO
```

Dependencies should install automatically.

## Known Issues
* Rarely, `SeedLink!` may cause a Julia session to hang when a connection fails to initialize.

## Changelog
### 2018-08-10
* Updated for Julia 0.7. Testing for 1.0.
* `wseis` has changed:
  + New syntax: `wseis(filename, objects)`
  + Keywords are no longer accepted.
* `SeisHdr` has changed:
  + The field `:mag` (magnitude) is now Tuple(Float32, String) to allow freeform magnitude scale designations. (was: Tuple(Float32, Char, Char))
* `batch_read` has been removed.
* Switched to HTTP.jl due to Requests.jl being abandoned by its creators.
  + In web requests, keyword `to=` (timeout) must now be an Integer. (was: Real)
* SeisIO objects can no longer be saved in single-object files.
* Notable bug fixes:
  + Issues with `wseis` and `SeisHdr` objects should be corrected.
  + Improved partial string matches for channel names and IDs.
