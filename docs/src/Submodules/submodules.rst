****************
Using Submodules
****************

At the Julia prompt, type *using SeisIO.NNNN* where NNNN is the submodule name; for example, ``using SeisIO.Quake`` loads the Quake submodule.


********
RandSeis
********

This submodule is used to quickly generate SeisIO objects with quasi-random
field contents. Access it with "using SeisIO.RandSeis"

The following are true of all random data objects generated by the RandSeis
module:

* Channels have SEED-compliant IDs, sampling frequencies, and data types.
* Random junk fills :notes and :misc.
* Sampling frequency (:fs) is chosen from a set of common values.
* Channel data are randomly generated.
* Time gaps are automatically inserted into regularly-sampled data.

.. function:: randPhaseCat()

Generate a random seismic phase catalog suitable for testing EventChannel,
EventTraceData, and SeisEvent objects.
:raw-html:`<br /><br />`

.. function:: randSeisChannel([,c=false, s=false])

Generate a SeisChannel of random data. Specify c=true for campaign-style
(irregularly-sampled) data (fs = 0.0); specify s=true to guarantee seismic data.
s=true overrides c=true.
:raw-html:`<br /><br />`

.. function:: randSeisData([, c=0.2, s=0.6])
.. function:: randSeisData(N[, c=0.2, s=0.6])

Generate 8 to 24 channels of random seismic data as a SeisData object. Specify *N* for a fixed number of channels.

* 100*c% of channels will have irregularly-sampled data (fs = 0.0)
* 100*s% of channels are guaranteed to have seismic data.

:raw-html:`<br />`

.. function:: randSeisEvent([, c=0.2, s=0.6])
.. function:: randSeisEvent(N[, c=0.2, s=0.6])

Generate a SeisEvent structure filled with random values. Specify *N* for a fixed number of channels.

* 100*c% of channels will have irregularly-sampled data (fs = 0.0)
* 100*s% of channels are guaranteed to have seismic data.

:raw-html:`<br />`

.. function:: randSeisHdr()

Generate a SeisHdr structure filled with random values.
:raw-html:`<br /><br />`

.. function:: randSeisSrc()

Generate a SeisSrc structure filled with random values.

****
SEED
****
Submodule for the Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake Data (SEED) file format; includes additional functionality.

.. function:: dataless_support()
   :noindex:

Dump status of dataless SEED blockette support to stdout.

.. function:: mseed_support()
   :noindex:

Dump status of mini-SEED blockette support to stdout.

.. function:: seed_support()
   :noindex:

Dump status of SEED blockette support to stdout.

Scanning SEED Volumes
*********************

.. function:: scan_seed(fname)

Scan a single SEED file and report on the contents. Much faster than *read_data* as no samples are decoded/read and most blockettes are skipped. Control output behavior with keywords.

Supported Keywords
------------------

.. csv-table::
  :header: KW, Type, Default, Meaning
  :delim: |
  :widths: 1, 1, 1, 3

  memmap    | Bool      | false     | memory-map file?
  npts      | Bool      | true      | output samples per channel?
  ngaps     | Bool      | true      | output time gaps per channel?
  nfs       | Bool      | true      | output number of fs vals per channel?
  quiet     | Bool      | false     | `true` prints nothing to stdout
  seg_times | Bool      | false     | output exact gap times?
  fs_times  | Bool      | false     | output exact times of fs changes?
  v         | Integer   | 0         | verbosity

Note that *seg_times* and *fs_times* dump verbose per-channel tabulation to stdout.

Users are encourage to submit feature request Issues if there's a need to scan for other changes within a SEED volume.

Interaction with Online Requests
--------------------------------
*scan_seed* cannot interact directly with online SEED requests. As a workaround, do ``get_data(..., w=true)`` to dump the raw request directly to disk, then scan the file(s) created.



**
UW
**

The UW submodule extends functionality for the University of Washington (UW) file format(s).

The UW data format was created in the 1970s by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN), USA, for event archival. It remained in use through the 1990s. A UW event is described by a pickfile and a corresponding data file, whose filenames were identical except for the last character. The data file is self-contained; the pick file is not required to read raw trace data. However, station locations were stored in an external text file.

Only UW-2 data files are supported by SeisIO. We have only seen UW-1 data files in Exabyte tapes from the 1980s.

.. function:: uwpf(pf[, v])

Read UW-format seismic pick file `pf`. Returns a tuple of (SeisHdr, SeisSrc).

.. function:: uwpf!(W, pf[, v::Int64=KW.v])

Read UW-format seismic pick info from pickfile `f` into SeisEvent object `W`. Overwrites W.source and W.hdr with pickfile information. Keyword `v` controls verbosity.
